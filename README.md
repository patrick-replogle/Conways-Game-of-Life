# Conway's Game of Life

Deployed front end url: https://conways-game-of-life-2020.herokuapp.com/

## Project Overview

Invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway in the late 1960's, the Game of Life is a cellular automaton played on a two dimensional
grid of cells. The first generation of cells is constructed by the user, however the game evolves naturally based off of a set of rules
without further user input, classifying the Game of Life as a zero-player-game.

A cell can only exist within two states, or respectively alive or dead. Which of the two states a cell will be in the next iteration of the board will be determined by the eight neighboring horizontal, vertical and diagonal cells that directly touch the cell.

Activate cells on the board at will, select a pattern from one of the presets, or click the random button to autopopulate the board and
watch the Game of Life unfold. Other user controls include the ability to adjust the generation cycle speed, change the cell color, and adjust the board size. The user can either watch the cycles play through in real time or click to view each cycle one at a time.

This implementation of the Game of Life was created using React hooks.
